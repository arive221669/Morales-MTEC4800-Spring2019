## Description

Interdisciplinary Team Project is an advanced course in the Emerging Media Technology program that provides an opportunity for students to apply the skills they've acquired in the course of pursuing their degree to a collaboratively designed and implemented project suitable for deployment in the real world.

NOTE: the project created in class will be displayed in the Emerging Media Technology Spring Show on May 2019. All work must be completed and tested well before this deadline.

## **Project Development**

Students will assess their collective skills and develop ideas for a number of candidate projects that leverage their skills. With the help of the professor, candidate projects will be evaluated.
Projects must be within budget, using the materials readily available within the Entertainment
Technology department; projects must be sufficiently ambitious, but not so ambitious that they cannot be accomplished within one semester; projects must leverage the existing skills of the students in the class, and provide opportunities for participation by everyone -- this does not, however, mean those unfamiliar technologies must be excluded.

Once candidate projects are selected, they will be winnowed by absolute veto -- that is, anyone in the class has the ability to veto any project without contest. This ensures that no one is forced to work on a project in which they have little interest. If the winnowing process removes all proposed projects, another brainstorming session takes place. After a winnowing process, if more than one project remains, each person votes for his/her favorite. The professor reserves the right to break a tie that may occur at this point.
